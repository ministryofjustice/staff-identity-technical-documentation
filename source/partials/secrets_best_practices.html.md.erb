### Client Secrets

#### Storing your new secret securely

Once we have sent you your new secret, it is essential that you store your new secret in a secure location such as

* In a secure vault such as `Azure Key Vault` or `AWS (Amazon Web Services) Secrets Manager`
* In a `GitHub` or `Azure DevOps` Secret variable, not as plain text

#### What not to do with your new secret

Do not store or share your secret anywhere else such as

* Any type of document such as spreadsheets or word processor documents
* Document/Content Management Systems such as SharePoint
* Send via email
* Locally on your computer

#### Problems, guidance, or incidents

If you lose, misconfigure, or accidentally expose your secret in any way or are unsure around the guidance above, contact the IDAM team (IDAMTeam@justice.gov.uk) immediately. We will revoke the old secret and generate a new one for you or provide one-to-one guidance on next steps.
