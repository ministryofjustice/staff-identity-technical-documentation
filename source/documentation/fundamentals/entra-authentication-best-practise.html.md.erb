# Enta Authentication Best Practise

## Latest Updates

### Microsoft Mandatory MFA Enforcement – Phase 2

Microsofts mandatory multifactor authentication (MFA) enforcement is entering Phase 2. If your organization hasnt requested an extension through the Entra portal, MFA will be automatically required for:

* Azure portal
* Microsoft Entra admin center
* Azure CLI
* Azure PowerShell
* Azure mobile app
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools
* REST API (Control Plane)
* Azure SDKs

This is especially important for those that currently use service accounts without Multi Factor Authentication

## Microsoft Authentication Recommendations

Microsofts recommended approach is to transition away from service accounts with passwords. Better options include:

* Managed Identities - [Microsofts Managed Identity Documentation](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
    * Ideal for resources already running in Azure (VMs, Functions, Logic Apps).
    * Eliminates credential management.
* Workload Identities - [Microsofts Workload Identity Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-overview)
    * Purpose-built for non-human interaction (Applications, Services, Scripts, or Containers)


## Example Authentication Best Practise Use Cases

### Use case 1: You run PowerShell or other Scripts via a service account 
Options:

1. Migrate your script to an azure run book which uses a Managed identity for authentication.

2. Configure a CICD pipeline in GitHub actions with federation between your app reg and GitHub actions via OIDC.

### Use case 2: You have a application that accesses Entra via GitHub Actions.
Options:

1. Federation between your app reg and GitHub actions via OIDC

2. Secret or Certificate for authentication (Whilst technically possible, this is no longer recommended).

### Use case 3: You use a service account with a 3rd party tool like Sharegate.
Options:

We can see no viable way to continue to use these tools without human interaction to authenticate without Multi Factor Authentication
