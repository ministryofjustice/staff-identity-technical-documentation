# Tenant Architecture

## Tenant Overview

![Tenant Overview](../../img/fundamentals-tenant-overview.png "Tenant Overview")

We have three environments that can be used with MoJ.

* DEVL
* NLE
* PROD

DEVL and PROD contain two Entra ID tenants. An Internal Workforce tenant and a External Workforce tenant.

NLE has only an Internal Workforce tenant.

### Internal vs External Workforce Tenants

Internal Workforce Tenants are the source of Justice identities and provide application registrations (SSO) for internal services.

External Workforce Tenants are using for application registrations (SSO) that are public facing. Identities in this tenant are either Guest users who can sign in to applications as a member of the public or Justice identities that are provisioned from the Internal Workforce tenant.
