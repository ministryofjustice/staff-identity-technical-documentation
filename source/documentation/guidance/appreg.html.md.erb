# Application Registrations (SSO)

## Best Practices

### Client Secrets

#### Storing your new secret securely

Once we have sent you your new secret, it is essential that you store your new secret in a secure location such as

* In a secure vault such as `Azure Key Vault` or `AWS (Amazon Web Services) Secrets Manager`
* In a `GitHub` or `Azure DevOps` Secret variable

#### What not to do with your new secret

Do not store or share your secret anywhere else such as

* Any type of document such as spreadsheets or word processor documents
* Document/Content Management Systems such as SharePoint
* Send via email
* Locally on your computer

#### Problems, guidance, or incidents

If you lose, misconfigure, or accidentally expose your secret in any way or are unsure around the guidance above, contact the IDAM team (IDAMTeam@justice.gov.uk) immediately. We will revoke the old secret and generate a new one for you or provide one-to-one guidance on next steps.

#### ServiceNow Client Secret Renewal

To renew a Client Secret used by your integration, you can make a request to the IDAM team via the [Entra Id - Renew App Registration Certificate / Secret](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4eaffa8d1b2dce10a1e2ddf0b24bcb14).

You will need to provide the following details

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Name       | Name of your application this secret is assigned to.                                                                          |
| Application ID         | Also referred to as your Client ID, this is the ID used in your integration to identify itself.                               |
| Environment            | Is this for the Entra DEV, NLE or LIVE environment.                                                                           |
| Please select what you would like to update | Select Certificate. |
| Old Secret Expiry Date | This will allow you to have two valid secrets while you update your integrations. We will remove the old secret on this date. |

This will then be assigned to the IDAM team to schedule and communicate when we will complete the request for you.

Once we have generated a new Secret, we will send the requestor of the catalogue item an email with a secure link to access the new credentials. This link will expire after an hour.

You should store this new value in a secure vault once received and remove any traces of it from your computer systems.

## Integration Testing with Entra ID

### Problem Statement

As a Developer, I want to create end to end integration tests for my application that integrates SSO with Entra ID and have access to test users in a Dev and Staging environment to test against in my GitHub PR Pipelines.

### What can you test

The IDAM team can provide you with a set of test users in our DEVL environment. These can be used in your automated testing.

To request test users and access to automated testing you should raise a Demand with the Demand team for the IDAM team to create the users and configure the Application Registration ready for use.

**We do not allow automated testing against our NLE and LIVE environment.**

#### Reasons for not allowing automated testing in NLE and LIVE

Due to security and governance standards, we cannot allow testing in these environments for the following reasons.

* Conditional Access Policies will prevent users from logging in. As these users will be logging in from a GitHub ephemeral environment, this log in will fail.
* NLE and LIVE users will require certain compliance rules preventing access in an automated way.
* Generic test users in NLE and LIVE pose an issue where passwords would be shared among multiple people and could be disabled or changed at any moment breaking path to live in pipelines.

Due to these limitations, it is not recommended to include the Entra ID log in flow as part of your integration tests in any environment apart from DEVL. To overcome the above scenarios, we would have to reduce our Security and Governance practices.

### Solution for testing in NLE and LIVE

We recommend you use a Mock OAuth Provider as part of your pipelines. This will enable you to have full control over Authorisation test scenarios during your testing and a faster feedback loop.

Many existing integrations follow this pattern, an example can be found below by OPG in their Sirius codebase which integrates with Entra ID.

[https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-sirius/tree/main/mock-oauth-provider](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/opg-sirius/tree/main/mock-oauth-provider)

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

### App Roles and Access Packages

#### Overview

As well as using Entra ID for your Authentication, you can also take advantage of App Roles and Access Packages to manage your integrating applications Authorisation.

Managing users this way over Security Groups or custom Authorisation layers in your application have multiple advantages

* JML processes will automatically remove access from your application when a user is deleted within Entra ID
* Approvals are handled through the Microsoft My Access portal requiring user authentication before assignment
* Audit trail of access requests
* Automated Access Reviews to ensure users have the right access
* Further Governance, i.e., those that do not have the Entra Role “Identity Governance Administrator” or assigned either [Delegation and roles in entitlement management - Microsoft Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-delegate#entitlement-management-roles) will not be able to add members to group without adding members to the access package
* Integration with wider Azure and Entra permissions and groups for automated assignment (future)

Access Packages sit under the Microsoft Entitlement Management offering. To learn more about Entitlement Management, Access Packages and App Roles, use the following links

* [What is entitlement management? - Microsoft Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-overview)
* [What are access reviews? - Microsoft Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview)
* [Add app roles to your application and receive them in the token.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps)

#### How App Roles works

Within the `App roles` option of your Application Registration, you can create custom App roles for each RBAC role type and link each Role to a Access Package. For example

| Role Name     | Access Package                                      |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator | eucs-idam-wordpress-administrators                  |
| Writer        | eucs-idam-wordpress-writers                         |
| Approver      | eucs-idam-wordpress-approvers                       |

When a user authenticates with Entra ID and is passed back to your application, Entra ID will check the user is a part of the Access Package and pass a `roles` claim via the authentication token for your application to parse.

* [Implement RBAC in your Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-implement-rbac-for-apps)

#### How Access Packages works

> For a detailed overview of Access Packages and how they are used to manage user access to resources, see [Request process and email notifications in entitlement management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/entitlement-management-process).

The IDAM Team will provide you with unique urls you can give to your users so that they can request access to the resource.

A user that needs access to a role for your application can submit an access request. When a request is approved, a process begins to assign the user access to the role for that application in the access package. The following diagram shows an overview of the process and the different states:

![Approval process diagram](../../img/ap-request-process.png "Approval process diagram")

If you're an approver, you're sent email notifications when you need to approve an access request. You also receive notifications when an access request has been completed. You're also sent email notifications that indicate the status of your request if you're a requestor.

Example email

![Approve request to access package email](../../img/ap-approver-request-email.png "Approve request to access package email")

If you have chosen to have Access Reviews for your Access Package, you will be sent regular emails to review each user within the Access Package. This can help maintain Just Enough Access for users in your system. For more information on how this process works, please see [What are access reviews? - Microsoft Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview).

#### Requesting App Roles and Access Packages

You will need to raise a Demand through the existing demand process for this option. This will be triaged by the Demand Team and sent through to the IDAM Team to action.

The link to the demand process can be found at [Technology Services New Demand Request](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DemandandBusinessRelationshipManagement/SitePages/New-Demand-Request.aspx)

You should provide the following information with the demand request.

##### List of Application Roles

Provide a list of required Application Roles in a list providing the information for each as outlined below.

| Field | Description | Example
|--|--|--|
| Display Name | Display name for the App role that appears, for e.g. in the assignment and consent experiences. | e.g. `Admin`, `Write`, `Read`, `ReadWrite`, etc |
| Role Value | Specifies the value which will be included in the "roles" claim of a token identifying a user or app which has been granted this app role. | e.g. `Users.Admin`, `Users.Write`, `Users.ReadWrite` |
| Description | App role help text that appears in the app assignment and consent experiences. | e.g. `Allows users Administrator rights over the Blog`. |

##### Access Package Details

| Field | Description | Example
|--|--|--|
| OrganisationName | Your organisation name. | `Justice Digital`, `Tech Services EUCS`, `CICA` |
| DepartmentName | Your departments name. | `LAA`, `OPG`, `IDAM` |
| ApplicationName | Your application name. | `ServiceNow`, `Slack`  |
| Access Package Approvers | A list of people who will be responsible for the approval of access to the packages. This should ideally be more than 2 people. | List of `@justice.gov.uk` addresses. |
| Require Access Reviews? | Does the requestor want to enable Access Reviews for their Access Package. If yes, complete the additional table below. For more information, see [What are access reviews? - Microsoft Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/access-reviews-overview) | `ServiceNow`, `Slack`  |

##### Access Review Details (optional)

| Field | Description | Example
|--|--|--|
| Access Package Reviewers | A list of people who will be responsible for the review of users who have access to the packages. This should ideally be more than 2 people. | List of `@justice.gov.uk` addresses. |
| Review frequency | How often do you want to review users access? This should be in days with a minimum of 30 days up to 365 days. | `365 days` |

## Token Lifetime Policy

We cannot offer custom policies to change the default Token Lifetime Policy (1 hour) within our tenant. Doing so would reduce our security posture to adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks and token theft.

e.g. If we changed this policy to 8 hours and a token was compromised, we would not be able to revoke the users session until this period has expired.

You should therefore implement refresh token functionality into your application. This will allow you to refresh the token before expiry and prevent the user to have to reauthenticate.

For guidance on using refresh tokens, see these following links

* [Refresh tokens in the Microsoft identity platform - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/refresh-tokens)
* [Access tokens in the Microsoft identity platform - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/refresh-tokens)
