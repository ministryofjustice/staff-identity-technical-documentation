If you have **not yet cloned the repo**, follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open Visual Studio Code and start a new terminal session. Then enter:

```powershell
mkdir $env:userprofile\git
cd $env:userprofile\git\
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/staff-identity-idam-entra-infra.git
cd staff-identity-idam-entra-infra
code .                   # Opens VS Code in this location
git checkout -b "branch-name"    # Create a new branch 
```

--- 

## Step 2: Update Repo and Create Feature Branch
If youve already cloned the repo locally, open the repo in VS Code (or IDE of your choice) and run the following in the terminal:

```bash
git pull
git checkout -b "IDAM-xxxx-name-of-your-feature-branch"
Replace IDAM-xxxx with the Jira ticket number linked to your change. 
```

## Step 3: Create the Terraform Folder Structure
Navigate to: `STAFF-IDENTITY-IDAM-ENTRA-INFRA/TERRAFORM/ENVS/REQUIRED_ENV`

Then complete the following:

1. Create a new folder in the root of the environment directory that you are deploying to, in the format `department-teamname`.

5. Update the `key` to match the new folder name. 
    -Specifically the `DEPARTMENT_NAME-TEAM_NAME` placeholder.

    - Update graph_delegated_permissions—leave as [] if none are needed.
