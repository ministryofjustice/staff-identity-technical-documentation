# IDAM Terraform App Registration Setup Guide

This guide walks engineers and developers through using Terraform in the [`staff-identity-idam-entra-infra`](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/staff-identity-idam-entra-infra) repository to create app registrations in Azure Entra ID.

---

## Prerequisites

If you have **already cloned the repo**, [skip ahead to step 4](#step-4-commit-and-push-your-changes) and commit and push your changes.

If you have **not yet cloned the repo**, follow the steps below.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open Visual Studio Code and start a new terminal session. Then enter:

```powershell
mkdir $env:userprofile\git
cd $env:userprofile\git\
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/staff-identity-idam-entra-infra.git
cd staff-identity-idam-entra-infra
code .                   # Opens VS Code in this location
git checkout -b "branch-name"    # Create a new branch 
```

--- 

## Step 2: Update Repo and Create Feature Branch
If youve already cloned the repo locally, open the repo in VS Code (or IDE of your choice) and run the following in the terminal:

```bash
git pull
git checkout -b "IDAM-xxxx-name-of-your-feature-branch"
Replace IDAM-xxxx with the Jira ticket number linked to your change. 
```

---

## Step 3: Create the Terraform Folder Structure
Navigate to:

STAFF-IDENTITY-IDAM-ENTRA-INFRA/TERRAFORM/ENVS/LIVE
Then complete the following:

- Create a new folder using your department/team name.

- Copy contents from the terraform-template  folder into your new folder.

- Update these files:
    - state.config: Update the `key` to match the new folder name. Specifically the `DEPARTMENT_NAME-TEAM_NAME` placeholder.

    ```hcl
    staff-identity-idam-entra-infra-DEAPRTMENT_NAME-TEAM_NAME-environmentName.tfstate
    ```

    - variables.tf:
        - Set default values based on your Jira ticket.
        - Update graph_delegated_permissions—leave as [] if none are needed.

    - main.tf:
        - Set appropriate tags.
        - Update the module source to the latest version. This can be found in the `Modules` folder, in the root of the directory.

---

## Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes
Once updates are complete, run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "xxxx"      # Replace xxxx with a descriptive commit message
git push
```

---

## Step 5: Create a Pull Request
- Visit the repo: staff-identity-idam-entra-infra
- You should see `Compare & pull request` — click it.
- Complete the PR form:
    - Purpose of the change
    - Jira ticket reference
- Click `Create pull request`

---

## Step 6: Review, Approve & Merge
* Wait for the GitHub Actions workflow to complete.
* Get approval from another member of the IDAM team.
* Merge the pull request into main.

---

## Step 7: Monitor Main Branch Actions

After merging:

    * Confirm that GitHub Actions run successfully.
    * If errors arise:
        - Create a new feature branch.
        - Fix the issue.
        - Raise another pull request.
        - Merge into main once fixed.

---

## Step 8: Request Graph Permissions
If Graph permissions are needed (delegated or application):
    * Mention this in your pull request.
    * The IDAM team will handle the admin consent process.
