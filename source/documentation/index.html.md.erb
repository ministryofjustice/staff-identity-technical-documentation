# EUCS IDAM End User Guidance

## Entra Security Groups

Entra Security Groups have the following uses.

* Allow you to control who has access to authenticate with your integrated application
* Classify groups of users to manage Roles and Permissions within an integrated application (see [Send Security Groups user belongs to in the authentication token](#send-security-groups-user-belongs-to-in-the-authentication-token))

Entra Security Groups are different from Azure Groups which provide permissions to resources within Azure.

A user can belong to 1 or many groups at one time.

There are four types of configuration your Application Registration may use for Entra Security Groups.

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All MoJ Users Security Group | Anyone who has an identity within the Ministry of Justice in Entra will be able to Authenticate to your application. Any Joiners or Leavers will automatically be added or removed for you. |
| Dynamic Security Group       | Built around pattern matching, this type of group allows you to specify automatic group assignment of Joiners and Leavers. This can be for example `Judiciary Only Group` that is setup to automatically add any users where their email address ends in `@judiciary.uk`. |
| [IDAM Team Managed Static Security Group](#idam-team-managed-static-security-group)                 | A group where users are manually added or removed as required. An example of this may be a small set of users across different departments who need access to a COTS application. |
| [Self Service Security Group](#self-service-security-group)                 | The ability to delegate responsibility for the management of users in the Security Group to a set of defined Owners. |

### Self Service Security Group

Upon request, the IDAM Team will set up 1 or many Security Groups for you and assign 2 or more people within your team as Owners of the group. These Owners will be responsible for the management of Users and Owners assigned to the group moving forward.

#### Governance

The IDAM Team will monitor Governance policies on the groups created. This includes

* Does the group have a minimum of 2 Owners
* Does the group only contain Members and not Guest users
* After 365 days, check if the group is still required

We will use the Owners of the group for any automated notifications for these policies where they are not met. This is to ensure groups are maintained and secure over time.

#### How to manage your Security Group

To manage your Security Groups, you will use the [Microsoft My Groups](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/groups/) interface.

##### Adding/Removing Users

* Go to the [Microsoft My Groups](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/groups/) web site
* Sign in with your Justice account
* Click `Groups I own`
* Click on the Group they wish to manage
* Click `Members`
* Click the `Add` button to begin adding new members

##### Adding/Removing Owners

* Go to the [Microsoft My Groups](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/groups/) web site
* Sign in with your Justice account
* Click `Groups I own`
* Click on the Group they wish to manage
* Click `Owners`
* Click the `Add` button to begin adding new owners

### IDAM Team Managed Static Security Group

#### Adding a new Entra Security Group

You will need to raise a Demand through the existing demand process for this option. This will be triaged by the Demand Team and sent through to the IDAM Team to action.

The link to the demand process can be found at [Technology Services New Demand Request](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DemandandBusinessRelationshipManagement/SitePages/New-Demand-Request.aspx)

You should provide the following information with the demand request.

* Who will be the Group Owners
    * minimum of 2 people, these people will be responsible for sign off of adding and removing users in the future
    * 1 or more Business Owners
    * 1 or more Technical Owners
* Name of the group
    * Pattern should be all lowercase `<organisation>-<team>-<function-of-group>`. e.g. `eucs-idam-cmsadministrators`
* Description on the purpose of the group (max 250 charaters)

> It is important that there are always 2 Owners minimum for these groups. Requests to add or remove users in the future will only be approved if these owners are the requestors or provide sign off.

#### Adding new users to a Entra Security Group

To add new users to a Entra Security Group, you can make a request to the IDAM team via the [ServiceNow Catalogue Item - Users in Microsoft Entra Groups- Add](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a784b93f1b118610a1e2ddf0b24bcbdc).

> Note: Before the IDAM Team can add or remove users, we must get approval from the Owners of the Security Group. If the requestor exists within the Owners group then this is sufficient.

You will need to provide the following details

| Field       | Description                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Users       | List of users email addresses to add to the group.  |
| Group Name  | Group name in Entra ID to add users too.            |
| Environment | Is this for the Entra DEV, NLE or LIVE environment. |

This will then be assigned to the IDAM team to schedule and communicate when we will complete the request.

[ServiceNow Catalogue Item - Users in Microsoft Entra Groups- Add](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=a784b93f1b118610a1e2ddf0b24bcbdc)

#### Removing users from a Entra Security Group

To remove users from a Entra Security Group, you can make a request to the IDAM team via the [ServiceNow Catalogue Item - Users in Microsoft Entra Groups - Delete](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e4e6c73b1bd5861025dc6351f54bcba6).

> Note: Before the IDAM Team can add or remove users, we must get approval from the Owners of the Security Group. If the requestor exists within the Owners group then this is sufficient.

You will need to provide the following details

| Field       | Description                                         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Users       | List of users email addresses to add to the group.  |
| Group Name  | Group name in Entra ID to add users too.            |
| Environment | Is this for the Entra DEV, NLE or LIVE environment. |

This will then be assigned to the IDAM team to schedule and communicate when we will complete the request.

[ServiceNow Catalogue Item - Users in Microsoft Entra Groups - Delete](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e4e6c73b1bd5861025dc6351f54bcba6)

### Send Security Groups in user Access token claim

Optionally, we can enable your SSO Application Registration to send a list of Security Group GUIDs that the user belongs too.

This can be benefitial for modern applications that require levels of authorisation within their application. 

For example, you could create 3 Security Groups as shown below and when a user logs in, the GUID will be passed down to the application. From here you can setup your application to assign the role appropriate for their group.

| Security Group Name        | GUID                                      | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eucs-idamn-cms-admins      | d7bbc93a-03e4-4f7f-83c9-5a6587b5412f      | Users assigned to this group have full admin access to application  |
| eucs-idam-cms-contributors | bb944abe-c965-43d2-81e5-ab2583d95b53      | Users assigned to this group have contributor access to application |
| eucs-idam-cms-readers      | 1c0500ad-df00-4101-9050-9b90440043c8      | Users assigned to this group have read only access to application   |

Instead of creating more resources to manage users and groups, you can use the Self Service Security Groups within Entra ID to manage users, and the groups they belong too via the [Microsoft My Groups interface](https://myaccount.microsoft.com/groups/).

Once the IDAM Team have setup the Security Group for you, we will pass the GUIDs to you and enable this functionality for your application.

For more information on what information exists within the access token, see this Microsoft article [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-token-claims-reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/access-token-claims-reference)

## Application Registrations (SSO)

### Renewing credentials

#### Client Secret Renewal

To renew a Client Secret used by your integration, you can make a request to the IDAM team via the [ServiceNow Catalogue Item - App Registration Secret - Renew](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4eaffa8d1b2dce10a1e2ddf0b24bcb14).

You will need to provide the following details

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Name       | Name of your application this secret is assigned to.                                                                          |
| Application ID         | Also referred to as your Client ID, this is the ID used in your integration to identify itself.                               |
| Environment            | Is this for the Entra DEV, NLE or LIVE environment.                                                                           |
| Old Secret Expiry Date | This will allow you to have two valid secrets while you update your integrations. We will remove the old secret on this date. |

This will then be assigned to the IDAM team to schedule and communicate when we will complete the request for you.

Once we have generated a new Secret, we will send the requestor of the catalogue item an email with a secure link to access the new credentials. This link will expire after an hour.

You should store this new value in a secure vault once received and remove any traces of it from your computer systems.

[ServiceNow Catalogue Item - App Registration Secret - Renew](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4eaffa8d1b2dce10a1e2ddf0b24bcb14)

#### Certificate Renewal

If you Application Registration uses Certificate Authentication for OIDC authentication, the following process will enable you to update your certificate in Entra ID.

- Create your new Certificate
- Export the Public Key (.cer file)
- Raise a Demand Request using the following link [Technology Services New Demand Request](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/sites/DemandandBusinessRelationshipManagement/SitePages/New-Demand-Request.aspx)
- Attach the Public Key to the Demand Request
- Provide the following information within the request

| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application Name       | Name of your application this certificate should be assigned to.                                                                         |
| Application ID         | Also referred to as your Client ID, this is the ID used in your integration to identify itself.                               |
| Environment            | Is this for the Entra DEV, NLE or LIVE environment.                                                                           |
| Old Certificate Expiry Date | This will allow you to have two valid certificates while you update your integrations. We will remove the old certificate on this date. |

Once the demand has been raised, the demand team will pass the information to the IDAM team to schedule in an implementation date. We will contact you once the demand has been received to confirm acceptance.

The average implementation time for a demand is 6-8 days. This is due to the IDAM team having to raise a Change Request to update the certificate.
