# User Authentication Policies

In order to access the Entra portal you will require a seperate Admin account. This account is seperate to your normal justice account and requires a higher form of MFA.

## Self Service password reset

### Internal Justice Users

Internal users will continue to be able to reset their password following the internal processes [described in this KBA](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=kb_article&table=kb_knowledge&sysparm_article=KB0026801).

### External Guest Users

External guests do not set a password for accessing our service. As a guest user, they use their own organisations authentication. Therefore there is no requirement for a password reset flow.

## Authentication rules (Internal and External)

### Re-authentication Frequency

Re-authentication for users is set for every 12 hours.

### Persistant Browser

Browser persistance is disabled. This means when a user closes their browser, on launching again, the user will have to re-authenticate into the site going through any MFA challenges.

### Continuos Access Evaluation

If a user moves between locations and their IP Address changes, they will be asked to re-authenticate to gain access again to the service.

## Risky Users

### Medium Risk Users

Should a user be marked as Medium risk by Entra, the user will be required to re-authenticate with their MFA every time they sign in to the service bypassing the standard once every 12 hours default.

### High Risk Users

If a user is marked as High Risk then access is blocked for this user. To unblock them, the user should contact the Service desk.
