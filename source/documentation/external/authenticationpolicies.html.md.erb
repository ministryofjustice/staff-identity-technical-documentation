## Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) Options

The following Multi Factor Authentication options are avaialble for both Internal and External users.

* (Default) Microsoft Authenticator (Push)
* Other Software Authenticator (Google Authenticator, 1password, Lastpass, etc)
* SMS/Phone

## Self Service password reset

### Internal Justice Users

Internal users will continue to be able to reset their password following the internal processes [described in this KBA](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=kb_article&table=kb_knowledge&sysparm_article=KB0026801).

### External Guest Users

External guests do not set a password for accessing our service. As a guest user, they use their own organisations authentication. Therefore there is no requirement for a password reset flow.

## Authentication rules (Internal and External)

### Re-authentication Frequency

Re-authentication for users is set for every 12 hours.

### Persistant Browser

Browser persistance is disabled. This means when a user closes their browser, on launching again, the user will have to re-authenticate into the site going through any MFA challenges.

### Continuos Access Evaluation

If a user moves between locations and their IP Address changes, they will be asked to re-authenticate to gain access again to the service.

## Risky Users

### Medium Risk Users

Should a user be marked as Medium risk by Entra, the user will be required to re-authenticate with their MFA every time they sign in to the service bypassing the standard once every 12 hours default.

### High Risk Users

If a user is marked as High Risk then access is blocked for this user. To unblock them, the user should contact the Service desk.

## Token Lifetime Policy

We cannot offer custom policies to change the default Token Lifetime Policy (1 hour) within our tenant. Doing so would reduce our security posture to adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks and token theft.

e.g. If we changed this policy to 8 hours and a token was compromised, we would not be able to revoke the users session until this period has expired.

You should therefore implement refresh token functionality into your application. This will allow you to refresh the token before expiry and prevent the user to have to re-authenticate.
