# Administrator Account Access

In order to access the Entra portal you will require a seperate Admin account. This account is seperate to your normal justice account and requires a higher form of MFA.

## Requesting an Administrator Account

To request a new Admin account you will need to fill out a request in the Slack channel [#staff-identity-external-authentication-service](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C091TMP805N) using the workflow option `New Admin Account`.

Once setup, a member of the team will securely send you your email and password to log in.

On first login you will be...

* Forced to change your default password
* Register for MFA using the Microsoft Authenticator (Push notifications)

> You *must* sign up for this MFA type in order to access the portals.

## Accessing the External Tenant

By default when you first log in you will see the Internal Entra ID Tenant. In order to switch to the External Entra ID Tenant, follow these steps.

* Go to the [Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com)
* Sign in as your Administrator account
* In the top right, click your email address and under `View account` click the link `Switch directory`
* On the next page, click `Switch` on the `Ministry of Justice External (Development)` option

## Request being added to a Access Package

When we set up your account, we will add you to a `Access Package`. This package will assign you certain Administrator Roles that you can elevate into should you need them. If you want more information on how you can elevate in to your Admin Role, see the page [Application Registrations (SSO)](/documentation/external/appregistration.html).
